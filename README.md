## 🚀 How to Run Locally

The site is currently running live on:
👉 **`http://localhost:8080`**

To run manually:
```bash
cd prismline-react
python3 -m http.server 8080
# Or: npx serve . -l 8080
```
Then open `http://localhost:8080` in any web browser.

## Deploy on Vercel

This repository includes `vercel.json` for deploying the static frontend with
security response headers.

1. Import `vssanjai/PrismLine` in Vercel.
2. Select **Other** as the framework preset.
3. Leave the build command and output directory empty.
4. Deploy from the `main` branch.

Vercel serves the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and image assets. Vercel does not run
the PHP endpoint in `api/contact.php`; keep that endpoint on a PHP-capable host
or migrate it to a supported serverless runtime before using the contact form
in production.

## 🌐 How to Host on GoDaddy (cPanel)

1. Log in to your **GoDaddy cPanel Hosting Account**.
2. Open **File Manager** and navigate to `public_html/`.
3. Upload all files from `Downloads/prismline/` into `public_html/` (including the `.htaccess`, `api/`, and `assets/` folders).
4. Ensure the `api/` directory has write permissions (`chmod 755` or `chmod 775`) so `leads_storage.json` can record inbound leads.
5. In `api/contact.php`, set `$to = "admin@prismline.com"` to your preferred notification email.

## 🔌 Connecting to a Custom Backend

In `assets/js/main.js`, line 9:
```javascript
const BACKEND_API_ENDPOINT = 'api/contact.php';
```
Your backend team can replace `'api/contact.php'` with their custom REST API endpoint (e.g., `https://api.prismline.com/v1/leads`).
